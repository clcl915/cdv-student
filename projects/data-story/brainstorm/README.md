## Three Good Datasets

### [The Complete Pokemon Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/pokemon?select=pokemon.csv)

**seriously very interested in this dataset ðŸ¤©**

This is the complete Pokemon dataset from seven generations of Pokemon. I remember being so addicted to playing Pokemon since I got my Nintendo DS. I even remember playing Pokemon on online emulators. I got the chance to play it again after years with my Nintendo Switch and I got reminded on how fun it is. Although I got frustrated with how I had to individually search for Pokemon on the official website to find out their abilities and weakness. I wished there was just one site that showed a comprehensive overall without having to click back and forth. 

Because there are so many generations and so many Pokemon, I would imagine to have a couple of visualizations for this project. 
 + a parallax scrolling effect of the seven generations
 + A basic grid with rows and columns of pokemon from 1st to 7th generation (with hover or popup window of additional information)
 + Radar chart with HP, attack, defense, speed, etc


### [Emoji Diet Nutritional Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ofrancisco/emoji-diet-nutritional-data-sr28)

This dataset is interesting because I find myself searching for food nutritional benefits quite often. I always feel like my bones need some helping. I think this Emoji Diet dataset would be cool to visualization and understand what exactly you are consuming and the health benefits. 

For visualization, I'm not quite sure what would look nice to visualize calories, carbs, total sugar, sodium, vitamin d, etc. 

 + maybe a vertical bar chart to show which has the most calories per gram. 


### [Sephora Foundation Shades](https://github.com/the-pudding/data/tree/master/foundation-names)

These datasets were used for The Pudding essay The Naked Truth article, where data was scraped from sites like Sephora and Ulta. I think it would be cool to scrape lipstick shades from cosmetic e-commerce sites to make a search for a particular shade. Because nowadays, you can find a lipstick in any shade. 

+ a donut chart or a color wheel with hover overs of a particular shade referencing back to the product name
+ bar chart of amount of lipsticks available of different colors ( number of pinks and reds lipsticks vs. number of black lipsticks)
