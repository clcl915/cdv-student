## Predictive Policing

**3 situations that come to mind about contemporary systems/applications in which data is used to predict the future in order to then act upon it**

1. Stock market -> observing trends to choose to short or long particulat stocks

2. Rush hour -> accommodating for higher and lower amounts of traffic. More trains during rush hair, less trains when traffic dies down

3. Post engagement  -> using data to calculate the highest average engagement to know when is the best time to post on social media platforms

**Thoughts on Prediction**

Social physics is "the possibility that human lives, like planets, had an underlying mechanistic trajectory" (Fry 2019). Prediction and mathematical analysis has been present in areas like crime, health care, accidents, etc. Predictive analysis is used by extracting information from data and formulating to identity the likelihood of future events. In Hannah Fry's article, I found it interesting how she opened with the Harold Shipman case, where he injected at least 215 patients with opiates. Later on at the end of the article, Fry noticed that it would have been "grossly inappopriate" to point suspicion to Shipman because he was dealing with higher-risk older patients. There was even another general practitioner that had a higher mortality rate than Shipman but was just unlucky working with an elderly population.

The Minority Report uses an interesting fictional story to emphasize the difference between the majority report and the miniority report. This tackles the "collective average vs individual fate" where in the 3 reports from the precogs,  Anderton was predicted to kill Kaplan from the majority report. The minority report stated that he wasn't going to kill Kaplan. But here Anderton chooses his own indivudal fate. Midway in the article, Anderton was asked whether he would choose to save himself or Precrime and he asked himself. But at the end, he ultimately chooses to save Precrime. The majority report was an illusion that was actually three different minority reports.         

In both the reading articles, prediction plays a profound role but still has many limitations. Predictive analysis and mathematical analysis helps us navigate through uncertain future events but doesn't necessarily determine these events.
