Wakey/Sleepy Times utilized data from a Google Form and transformed it into JSON format. This data was then visualized with simple HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript.

Vistors can toggle the üåô and ‚òÄÔ∏è button to show when our surveyers sleep and wake up. Vistors can also click on different days of the week to see the difference between weekday and weekend patterns.
